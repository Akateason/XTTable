/** Helps clean up code for changing UIView frames.
 
 Instead of creating a CGRect struct, changing properties and reassigning. For example, moving a UIView newX points to the left:
 
    CGRect frame = view.frame;
    frame.origin x = (CGFloat)newX + view.frame.size.width;
    view.frame = frame;
 
 This can be cleaned up to:
 
    view.left += newX;
 
 Properties bottom and right also take into account the width of the UIView.
